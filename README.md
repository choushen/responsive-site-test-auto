# Website Automation Suite Practice

## Introduction
This README provides information on a practice website designed for writing and testing an automation suite. The website contains various controls and features that are ideal for practicing locator scraping and identifying potential improvements or trivial bugs.

## Website Overview
The practice website is a sandbox environment where QA professionals can enhance their skills in automation testing. It includes a range of controls such as buttons, forms, dropdowns, and dynamic content that testers can use to write and execute test scripts.

## Locator Scraping
Testers can scrape locators such as IDs, classes, XPaths, and CSS selectors that are essential for automation. The website's HTML structure is designed to simulate real-world applications, providing a comprehensive scraping experience.

## Writing Trivial Bugs
The website includes intentional flaws that serve as a basis for writing trivial bugs. Testers can report these as part of their practice. For example:

- "The 'Submit' button's color scheme could be improved to enhance visibility."
- "The font size for the error messages is too small, making them difficult to read. Increasing the font size could improve user experience."

## Getting Started
To begin writing your automation suite against the practice website, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the website URL provided.
2. Familiarize yourself with the controls and features available on the website.
3. Start by writing test cases for simple actions and gradually move on to more complex scenarios.
4. Practice scraping locators for different controls and use them in your automation scripts.
5. Identify potential trivial bugs and consider how they could be reported or improved.

Happy Testing!
